# Privacy Policy

The React Executor Devtools ("The extension") takes your privacy seriously. This extension requires permissions to
access the executors created by the React Executor ("The library"). Both the library and the extension do not transmit
any data remotely. They both are fully open source, and you can find their source code
at https://github.com/smikhalevski/react-executor and https://github.com/smikhalevski/react-executor-devtools
respectively.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 13 May 2024 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its
provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

I reserve the right to update or change the Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy
periodically.
